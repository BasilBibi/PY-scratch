This is a scratch project for general messing around and experimentation.

To run all unit tests do the following :

```
cd <path to PY-scratch top level project dir> 

e.g. ~/Documents/dev/source/PY-scratch

Then run unittest in discover mode with verbose switch :
$ python -m unittest discover -v
```
